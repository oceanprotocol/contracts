# Solidity API

## ERC165

_Implementation of the {IERC165} interface.

Contracts may inherit from this and call {_registerInterface} to declare
their support of an interface._

### constructor

```solidity
constructor() internal
```

### supportsInterface

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC165-supportsInterface}.

Time complexity O(1), guaranteed to always use less than 30 000 gas._

### _registerInterface

```solidity
function _registerInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) internal virtual
```

_Registers the contract as an implementer of the interface defined by
`interfaceId`. Support of the actual ERC165 interface is automatic and
registering its interface id is not required.

See {IERC165-supportsInterface}.

Requirements:

- `interfaceId` cannot be the ERC165 invalid interface (`0xffffffff`)._
