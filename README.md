<!-- With ocean v4, you can:

- **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data.
  Ocean creates a new [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md)
  datatoken for each dataset / data service.
- **Mint** datatokens for the service
- **Sell** datatokens via an OCEAN-datatoken Balancer pool (for auto price discovery), or for a fixed price
- **Stake** OCEAN on datatoken pools
- **Consume** datatokens, to access the service
- **Transfer** datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC20 actions**
  using [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.9/web3-eth-contract.html) etc. -->

ocean v4 is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

This is in alpha state and you can expect running into problems. If you run into them, please open up a [new issue](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).

## 🏗 Installation

For quick installation of the contract `ABIs`:

### Javascript/Typescript
```bash
npm install @oceanprotocol/contracts
```
### Python
```bash
pip3 install ocean-contracts
```
## ⚙️ Usage
By default, Python does not support importing `json` files directly, so it is recommended to use `json-sempai` package in order to automatically importing `ABIs/json` artifacts.
```
pip3 install json-sempai
# install the ocean-contracts package.
```
```python
from jsonsempai import magic
from artifacts import address

```

## 🏄 Quickstart



### What's New - Features

- Base IP is now represented by an NFT, from which a datapublisher can deploy multiple ERC20 which can represent different type of access for the same dataset. (Link to NFT blog)

- Rug pulls are solved thanks to a special 1 Sided Staking contract which acts as a bot, preventing big prices swings:
 An automated DT staking and vesting contract which helps with initial DT distribution and price stability.
more info on how it works: (link to Side staking blog)

- Help Ocean community: if Ocean is not the basetoken, Ocean Community will receive 1% swap fee on pools or fixed price exchange.
Detailed information: (link to blog post on ocean community monetization)




#### Flexibility

- Roles Administration: there are now multiple roles for a more flexible administation both at NFT and ERC20 levels.

- Key-value store in the NFT contract : NFT contract can be used to store custom key-value pairs (ERC725Y standard)

- Advanced fee structure both for Markets and Provider. (link to fee post/docs)

- Multiple NFT template support: the Factory can deploy different types of NFT templates. 

- Multiple ERC20 template support: the Factory can deploy different types of ERC20 templates

## 🏄 Quickstart

The [ocean.js](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js) and [ocean.py](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py) libraries wrap `contracts` in JavaScript and Python respectively. They each have quickstart guides.

## 🦑 Development


```bash
npm install
npx hardhat node
```


## 🛳 Network Deployments

You can use an existing deployment of Ocean contracts, deploy locally or deploy to a remote network. Let's review each.

#### Use existing deployments

Ocean contracts are deployed to Rinkeby, Mumbai, and more. [Here are details](../artifacts/address.json).

#### 🦑Deploy Locally or Remote (e.g. Rinkeby)

* In your main terminal:
```bash
deploy on hardhat:
export NETWORK_RPC_URL='NETWORK_RPC_URL SHOULD BE HERE' (i.e: http://127.0.0.1:8545)

deploy on remote networks:
export NETWORK_RPC_URL='NETWORK_RPC_URL SHOULD BE HERE' (i.e: INFURA OR ALCHEMY URL)

npm run deploy
```

## 👩‍🔬 Testing


You can execute all tests with:

```bash
# run hardhat node each time you want to test with the current settings
npx hardhat node

npm run test:full
# same thing, but with coverage reporting
npm run test:full:cover
```

<!-- Test suite for unit & integration tests is setup with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) as test runner, and [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) for coverage reporting. A combined coverage report is sent to CodeClimate via the `coverage` GitHub Actions job.

Running all tests requires running Ocean Protocol components beforehand with [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge), which also runs a `ganache-cli` instance:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge
cd barge

./start_ocean.sh --with-provider2 --no-dashboard
```

You can then proceed to run in another terminal.

Let ocean.js know where to pickup the smart contract addresses, which has been written out by Barge in this location:

```
export ADDRESS_FILE="${HOME}/.ocean/ocean-contracts/artifacts/address.json"
```

Build metadata:

```
npm run build:metadata
```

Executing linting, type checking, unit, and integration tests with coverage reporting all in one go:

```bash
npm test
``` -->

### Unit Tests

You can execute unit tests with:

```bash
# run hardhat node each time you want to test with the current settings
npx hardhat node

npm run test:unit

```

### Flow Tests

You can execute flow tests with:

```bash
# run hardhat node each time you want to test with the current settings
npx hardhat node

npm run test:flow

```

<!-- ## 🛳 Production

To create a production build, run from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run build
``` -->

<!-- ## ⬆️ Releases

Releases are managed semi-automatically. They are always manually triggered from a developer's machine with release scripts.

### Production

From a clean `main` branch you can run the release task bumping the version accordingly based on semantic versioning:

```bash
npm run release
```

The task does the following:

- bumps the project version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- auto-generates and updates the CHANGELOG.md file from commit messages
- creates a Git tag
- commits and pushes everything
- creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
- Git tag push will trigger a GitHub Action workflow to do a npm release

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases) -->
