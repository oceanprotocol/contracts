## 🏗 Installation

For quick installation of the contract `ABIs`:

```bash
npm i @oceanprotocol/contracts
```

## 🏄 Quickstart

The [ocean.js](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js) and [ocean.py](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py) libraries wrap `contracts` in JavaScript and Python respectively. They each have quickstart guides.


## 🛳 Network Deployments

You can use an existing deployment of Ocean contracts, or do your own deployment for testing. Let's review each.

#### Use existing deployments

Ocean contracts are deployed to Rinkeby, Ethereum mainnet, and maybe more. [Here are details](docs/README.md#deployments).

#### Do your own deployment

To deploy to a local testnet:
* In a separate terminal, start the testnet: `ganache-cli`
* In your main terminal, run: `npm run deploy`

Alternatively, to deploy to rinkeby testnet:
* In your main terminal:
```
export MNEMONIC='YOUR MNEMONIC SHOULD BE HERE'

# If you are using remote test or Etherejm mainnet using Infura
export INFURA_TOKEN='GET INFURA_TOKEN FROM INFURA PLATFORM' 

npm run deploy:rinkeby
```

After deployment, check out the `./artifacts/address.json` file. It contains the addresses of the deployed contracts. It will have been updated for the network you deployed to (e.g. `development`).

## 🦑 Local Development

For local development of `contracts`, set up the development environment on your machine as follows.

As a prerequisite, you need:

- Node.js v12+
- npm

Clone the project and install all dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/ocean-contracts.git
cd ocean-contracts/

# install packages
npm i

# to compile contracts
npm run compile
```

## ✨ Code Style

Linting is setup for `JavaScript` with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) & Solidity with [Ethlint](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Ethlint).

```bash
# to check lint issues
npm run lint
```

## 👩‍🔬 Testing

Run tests with 

```bash
# for unit tests
npm run test:unit

# for test coverage
npm run test:cover
```


Code style is enforced through the CI test process, builds will fail if there're any linting errors.

## ⬆️ Releases

[Submit contributions with this workflow](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/contributing/#fix-or-improve-core-software).

Generate documentation using `solidity-docgen`:

```bash
npm run doc:generate
```

[Do a release using this process](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md).
